My name is Timur, I'm a Helsinki-based software developer currently working at [Futurice](https://futurice.com). At work I primarily build backend applications that run in clouds. In general, I'm interested in a vast range of topics: hardware, music, video games, and many more.

In this blog, I usually write about approaches and techniques that help us build more efficient software.

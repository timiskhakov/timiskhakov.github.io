Hi there!

I don't often talk, let alone write, about myself, so this might be a bit awkward.

My name is Timur, and I'm a software developer based in lovely Helsinki, Finland. I currently work at [Sharper Shape](https://sharpershape.com), where I develop and maintain systems and tools that build [digital twins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin) and deliver transmission and distribution inspection solutions. This may sound somewhat clunky, but in practice it means that we fly drones or helicopters over electrical grids to capture aerial images, LiDAR point clouds, and trajectory data. This data is then processed to filter out irrelevant information, detect objects, and perform various analyses. We store the results and make them efficiently accessible to a range of consumers, including the web viewer, ML models, and client applications.

I'm passionate about building scalable and reliable systems, ideally simple too, though real-world complexity often has other plans. I'm usually involved in the entire development lifecycle: designing, programming, delivering, and maintaining software. For over a decade, I worked primarily in the .NET ecosystem, focusing on both desktop and backend applications. These days, I mostly work with Go, jumping occasionally into Python. Overall, I worked with and have experience in: .NET/.NET Core, C#, Go, Docker, Azure, AWS, SQL databases, and distributed systems.

In my free time, I enjoy learning about and exploring new things mainly related to computers and
programming, some of which you can find in this blog. And speaking of what you'll find here, in no particular order:
- ideas and approaches for building more efficient software, sometimes going a bit too extreme
- benchmarks
- references to 90s and early 2000s video games, sci-fi books, and movies
- various comparisons: apples to apples, apples to bananas, apples to nvidias
- more benchmarks, not necessarily proving a stated point
- occasional posts without benchmarks

When I'm not tinkering with computers, I enjoy reading books, playing video games, running, and traveling.

### Talks

I've done ~~a couple of~~ two public talks, there were no recordings, but I have slides that might be worth taking a look at:
- "Programming Guitar Music" at a [GDG Berlin Golang meetup](https://www.meetup.com/golang-users-berlin/events/288051077) in September 2022: [slides](https://github.com/timiskhakov/music-slides)
- "Exploring Spans and Pipelines" at [Tampere.NET first meetup](https://meetabit.com/events/first-meetup) in February 2020: [slides](https://github.com/timiskhakov/ExploringSpansAndPipelines/blob/master/exploring-spans-and-pipelines.pdf)
